# Abstract
Today we live in a society submerged in social networks, massive structures of information that seem impossible to treat and study. That is why it is necessary to find basic properties that allow us to
locate what we are looking for, quickly and effectively. In this project we use an extract from the IMDB database to study if it is possible to easily find the most influential nodes within the communities of a
graph. For this, a specific definition of "influence" will be used, along with the community detection algorithm k-means and the ranking algorithm PageRank.
